Shilo is a 2D platformer meant to test your patience and perseverance.  Follow a young girl and her bubble as she traverses 100 rooms to discover who (or what) she really is.

This was a prototype game made over 2 weeks for the [GDKO 2023 - Round 1](https://itch.io/jam/gdko-2023) game jam.  The focus was on art and visual design.  There are some issues with the mechanics.  If you get stuck on a wall, refresh the page.  You should restart in the same room.  This project is no longer being actively developed.

The final game submission can be played directly in your browser here: [Shilo on itch.io](https://mitchellopitz.itch.io/shilo).

I really like the direction this project took.  If you enjoy the game and would like to see more, be sure to comment and let me know!

# Inspiration

Shilo is inspired by the legend of the koi fish.  In this Chinese legend, a group of koi come to a waterfall.  For 100 years, they attempt to jump up it.  Eventually, one succeeds and is turned into a dragon by the gods.

I wanted to play with this idea of water, bubbles, koi, and the sakura blossoms.

# How to Play

Run and jump to traverse the level.

Pop your bubble to dash in any direction.

Touch water blocks during a dash to gain another bubble (and dash again!)

Collect your koi fish friends along the way.
